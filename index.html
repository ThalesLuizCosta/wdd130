        <p>Hello! My name is Thales and I'm from Santos Brazil, I love being with my family, they are an essential part of me, I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since 2003, I served a mission in Brazil Salvador Sul, I love surfing (but I still don't have time for that), I'm very grateful for everything our Heavenly Father blesses us so much,  Because I love nature, I love animals and most of all... I love being alive and being able to breathe the good air that God has given us, I am always serving others, as our Savior Jesus Christ taught us, "he who wants to be the greatest in the kingdom of God, let him also be your servant," then if I am here for one purpose, it is to serve people. That's it!</p>
